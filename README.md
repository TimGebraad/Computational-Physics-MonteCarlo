Monte Carlo methods to analyse small quantum systems

DataProduction.py
Code containing the different used Monte Carlo methods (VMC, DMC and guided DMC) for determining complex multidimensional integrals including parameter minimizers.
Description of the different systems that can be analyzed (Harmonic Potential 1D/3D, Hydrogen Atom, Helium Atom and Hydrogen Molecule) with the corresponding functions needed for the Monte Carlo Methods.

DataAnalysis.py
Function to import the data produced in DataProduction.py with plotting procedures and fitting procedures to determine potential landscape, frequencies and vibrational spectrum including uncertainties.
Another function to plot and compare the electron probability distribution (wavefunction) of the imported data relative to the r and x component.
